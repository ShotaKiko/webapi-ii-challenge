1.) When i added the post request it somehow modified the binary code in data/lambda.db3. Cant view the file though

2.) reconfirm why router.use(express.json()) not needed to bind body to req

3.) What does deconstructing id from params to exactly when trying to get by id

4.) Look into how to nest for different catch errors 404 vs 500 (for getbyid and delete endpoints)
